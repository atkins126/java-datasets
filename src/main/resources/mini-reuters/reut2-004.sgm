<TITLE>INCO SEES NO MAJOR IMPACT FROM DOW REMOVAL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Inco Ltd said it did not expect its
earlier reported removal from the Dow Jones industrial index to
make a major impact on the company's stock.
    "We don't think that individuals or institutions buy our
shares because we were one of the Dow Jones industrials,"
spokesman Ken Cherney said in reply to a query.
    Inco closed 1-3/8 lower at 19-3/8 in second most active
trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
    The Wall Street Journal, which selects the index, said Inco
was dropped to make the index more representative of the
market. Inco, the non-Communist world's largest nickel
producer, was a member of the index since 1928.
    Replacing Inco and Owens-Illinois Inc will be Coca-Cola Co
and Boeing Co, effective tomorrow.
    Nickel analyst Ilmar Martens at Walwyn Stodgell Cochran
Murray Ltd said Inco's removal from the index would likely
spark short-term selling pressure on the stock.
    "Some investors who have Inco may suddenly say, 'well,
because it's not now a Dow stock, we should eliminate that
investment,'" said Martens, although he added the move was
unlikely to have a serious long-term impact on Inco stock.
    Inco has struggled in recent years against sharply lower
nickel prices. Its net earnings fell to 200,000 U.S. dlrs in
1986 from 52.2 mln dlrs the previous year.

<TITLE>DOCTORS FIND LINK BETWEEN AIDS, SMALLPOX VIRUS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOSTON, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>In a discovery that could complicate the
search for an AIDS vaccine, a team of U.S. Army doctors said
they have uncovered a potentially-fatal interaction between the
AIDS virus and a virus used to protect against smallpox.
     Physicians at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research
said a 19-year-old man, who apparently had been exposed to the
AIDS virus, developed a pox-like disease and died after
receiving the smallpox vaccine. The military now tests recruits
for AIDS before vaccinating them.
    The findings, reported in The New England Journal of
Medicine, are significant because scientists have begun working
on an AIDS vaccine that relies on the smallpox vaccine.
     "Our case report raises provocative questions concerning
the ultimate safety of such vaccines," said the group led by
Dr. Robert Redfield.
     The report also throws into question the belief held by
some scientists that the smallpox vaccine, which exposes people
to a milder, protective form of the disease known as cowpox,
could be further modified to protect people against a host of
other diseases.

<TITLE>BIRTH CONTROL PILLS HELP PREVENT CANCER - STUDY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BOSTON, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Doctors at the Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta said they have new evidence that birth
control pills can help provide long-term protection from cancer
of the ovary, even if the pills are only taken for a few
months.
     The study, reported in the New England Journal of
Medicine, also found that all the various types of oral
contraceptives on the market were equally effective in lowering
the rate of ovarian cancer.
     The researchers estimated that the use of birth control
pills in this country probably prevented about 1,700 cases of
ovarian cancer in 1982.
    As more and more women who have taken oral contraceptives
"move into the age groups that are at highest risk for
epithelial ovarian cancer we may witness a declining incidence
of this serious disease," they said.
     Specifically, the team led by Dr. Howard Ory found that
"oral contraceptive use, even for a few months, reduces the
risk of epithelial ovarian cancer by 40 percent for women 20 to
54 years of age.
     "The effect probably takes from five to ten years to
become apparent, but it persists long after the use of oral
contraceptives ends. Moreover, protection exists regardless of
the formulation of oral contraceptive used," they said.

<TITLE>U.S. ECONOMIC DATA KEY TO DEBT FUTURES OUTLOOK</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Brad Schade, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    CHICAGO, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>U.S. economic data this week could be
the key in determining whether U.S. interest rate futures break
out of a 3-1/2 month trading range, financial analysts said.
    Although market expectations are for February U.S. retail
sales Thursday and industrial production Friday to show healthy
gains, figures within or slightly below expectations would be
positive for the market, the analysts said.
    "You have to be impressed with the resiliency of bonds
right now," said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig
Sloane.
    Treasury bond futures came under pressure today which
traders linked to a persistently firm federal funds rate and a
rise in oil prices. However, when sufficient selling interest
to break below chart support in the June contract failed to
materialize, participants who had sold bond futures early
quickly covered short positions, they said.
    "Everyone is expecting strong numbers, and if they come in
as expected it won't be that bad for the market," Sloane said.
    Sloane said the consensus estimate for the non-auto sector
of retail sales is for a rise of 0.6 to 0.7 pct.
    Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs said a retail sales figure
below market forecasts would give a boost to debt futures, and
she put the range for the non-auto sector of retail sales at up
0.8 to 1.2 pct.
    Industrial production and the producer price index Friday
both are expected to show increases of about 0.5 pct, she
added.
    Retail sales "will tell us whether or not we will be able
to fill the gap," Gibbs said, referring to a chart gap in June
bonds between 100-26/32 and 101-3/32 created Friday. June bonds
closed at 100-4/32 today.
    Also key to debt futures direction, in addition to the
federal funds rate, is the direction of crude oil prices, said
Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures analyst Brian Singer.
    "A higher fed funds rate and firm oil prices precluded the
market from breaking out of the trading range the last time the
market approached the top of the range," Singer said.
    In order for bonds to break above the top of the range,
which is just below 102 in the June contract, "the crude oil
rally needs to run its course and pull back a little bit,"
Singer said. "Fed funds are already easing back down toward the
six pct level."
    The recent surge in oil prices has also been a concern to
Manufacturers Hanover Futures analyst Jim Rozich, but the rally
may be nearing a top around 18.50 dlrs per barrel, he said.
    Rozich said he is looking for the June bond contract to
ease to 99-6/32 and find support.
    "I'm not quite ready to jump on the bullish bandwagon yet.
The jury is still out this week," Rozich said.

<TITLE>U.S. "ACTION PROGRAM" FOR SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Reagan administration,
responding to last year's United Nations special session on
Africa, today outlined a U.S. "action program" for sub-Saharan
Africa focusing heavily on economic reform and self-help.
    A White House statement announced establishment of "a
long-term U.S. goal for all U.S. economic programs and policies
in sub-Saharan Africa: to end hunger in the region through
economic growth, policy reform and private sector development."
    The statement said the "program of action" was recommended by
a White House task force set up last September.
    In a series of recommendations, the task force called for
new efforts to address Africa's heavy debt burden and said U.S.
food aid should stress production incentives to reinforce
African nations' economic reform and productivity.
    It also said better African access to world markets should
be promoted to reward good performance and enable African
nations to earn their way toward economic growth.
    The U.S. private sector should be mobilized to provide
"private, voluntary and corporate involvement of a humanitarian
    It said donor countries "should negotiate, through the
existing International Monetary Fund/World Bank coordination
process, framework agreements with each sub-Saharan African
country to establish long-term structural adjustment and reform
programs."
    The task force called for a separate budget account for
U.S. bilateral aid "in order to focus better on rewarding
economic performance and increasing the flexibility of U.S.
assistance programs for incentive economic reforms and private
sector development."

<TITLE>UNUSUAL TEXAS INSTRUMENTS &lt;TXN> PREFERRED PRICED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>In a novel type of financing, Texas
Instruments Inc marketed a three-part, 225 mln dlr issue of
convertible money market preferred stock through Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc as sole manager.
    Shearson, which originated the new convertible concept,
said each of the three tranches totaled 75 mln dlrs. In the
first, a 2.85 pct dividend was set on the stock with a strike
price of 190 dlrs that represented a 15 pct premium over the
common stock price when terms were set.
    Also included were 4.36 pct dividend preferred with a 220
dlr strike price and 33 pct premium and 4.49 pct dividend
preferred with a 235 dlr strike price and 42 pct premium.
    Texas Instruments common closed at 167.25 dlrs, up 2-1/8.
    Ronald Gallatin, managing director at Shearson, said that
"demand for the offering was unbelievable, especially for the
first tranche."
    He said that Shearson originated the concept of auction
money market preferred stock three years ago. The conversion
feature of this issue is the new wrinkle.
    Commenting on the first tranche, Gallatin noted that the
original pricing talk called for a dividend in the four to 4.20
pct area. This was gradually cut to 2.85 pct because of intense
demand, saving the issuer money in financing costs.
    The Shearson official said that virtually all buyers of the
first tranche received less than they wanted. He said the
latter two tranches were less strongly oversubscribed.
    Like non-convertible money market preferred stock, the new
version allows investors to redeem their holdings every seven
weeks. Investors then can maintain their holdings, sell them,
or offer to hold on to the securities if the auction
dividend is at least at a level they specify in advance.
    Gallatin said the securities were sold to a broad range of
investors, including major insurance companies, banks, money
managers and pension funds.

<TITLE>CLARK SAYS HE EXPECTS U.S. ACTION ON ACID RAIN</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Canadian Foreign Secretary Joe
Clark, winding up a two-day visit to Washington, said he
expected the Reagan administration to take some action on
reducing acid rain.
    "My impression is there will be some movement by the United
States administration on acid rain (but) how much movement I
can't judge or predict," he told reporters.
    The meetings with American officials are part of a routine
U.S.-Canada consultation but are also expected to lay the
groundwork for a summit in Ottawa next month between President
Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
    Clark today held discussions with Treasury Secretary James
Baker and Democratic Sens. Patrick Moynihan of New York,
Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and
George Mitchell of Maine.
    Yesterday, he held talks with Vice President George Bush,
Secretary of State George Shultz and Commerce Secretary Malcolm
Baldrige.
    Among its priorities, Canada is seeking evidence that
Reagan is prepared to live up to a commitment made last year to
implement in the United States a five-year 5 billion U.S. dlr
program to test cleaner ways of burning coal.
    This issue was discussed at length with Baker and several
of the senators, including Mitchell who urged Canada to "keep
the heat on" the Reagan administration to force action, Canadian
officials said.
    Also taken up with most of the senators and Baker were
trade issues, including the need for the United States and
Canada to establish a better mechanism for settling trade
disputes between the two countries, who are each other's major
trading partner, Canadian officials said.

billion dlr foreign debt and will reduce its obligations by 300
mln dlrs this year, prime minister edward seaga said today.
    Speaking at a news conference, seaga said jamaica has

more borrowing until it is justified by economic growth.
    "this year we'll be reducing the stock of debt by 300
million dollars," he said.
    He told reporters his government aims to reduce jamaica's
ratio of debt payments to foreign exchange earnings from the
current 50 pct to 25 pct within three years.
    Debt payments this year are expected to total 287 mln
dollars, seaga said.

<TITLE>FASTER TEST FOR SICKLE CELL ANEMIA DEVELOPED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>   BOSTON, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>A team of California researchers said
that they have developed a better, faster test for detecting
sickle cell anemia in unborn children than existing procedures.
     The test, developed by Cetus Corp &lt;CTUS> researchers,
requires only a small amount of genetic material from a fetus
and produces a diagnosis within a day, unlike other tests that
require several days and can only be done in a few specialized
centers, they said.
     Sickle cell anemia is a painful, inherited blood disease
that causes the normally-flexible red blood cells to stiffen
into a sickle-like shape. It is primarily found in blacks.
    The researchers said in The New England Journal of Medicine
that their "procedure promises to be a rapid, sensitive and
reliable method for the prenatal diagnosis of sickle cell
disease."
     In addition, they said, the technique might also be
adapted to detect other types of genetic disease.

<TITLE>USX &lt;X> PROVED OIL, GAS RESERVES FALL IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>USX Corp said proved reserves of oil
and natural gas liquids fell 28 pct to 802.8 mln barrels at the
end of 1986 from 1.12 billion barrels at year-end 1985.
    The figures, in USX's just-released 1986 annual report,
indicate much of the drop resulted from the exclusion of 293.7
mln barrels of Libyan reserves, after the U.S. government last
June directed U.S. oil companies to end Libyan operations.
    USX, which owns Marathon Oil Co and Texas Oil and Gas Corp,
had 60 pct of its 1986 sales of 14.94 billion dlrs from its oil
and gas operations.
    About 24 pct of total sales came from USX's USS steel unit
and 16 pct from diversified businesses, which include oilfield
services, raw materials, minerals, chemicals and real estate.
    According to the report, domestic liquids reserves fell
slightly to 628.5 mln barrels from 628.9 mln and foreign
reserves fell to 174.3 mln from 486.4 mln barrels. The large
drop in foreign reserves was in the Middle East and Africa,
where they fell to about 9.3 mln barrels from 316.7 mln,
reflecting the exclusion of Libya.
    Total natural gas reserves fell to 4.82 trillion cubic feet
at year-end 1986 from 5.18 trillion at the end of 1985.
    Again, most of the drop came from the Middle East and
Africa, where reserves fell to zero from 71.9 billion cubic
feet, excluding Libyan reserves.
    U.S. natural gas reserves fell to 3.44 trillion cubic feet
from 3.65 trillion and foreign reserves fell to 1.38 trillion
from 1.53 trillion.
    In other areas, USX said total capital spending fell to 962
mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.78 billion dlrs in 1985. The 1986
audited figure is eight mln dlrs higher than the unaudited
figure the company reported on Jan 27.
    USX also said it expects to record a gain of 150 mln dlrs
in 1988, representing 50 pct of previously existing investment
tax credits allowable under the new tax law. The loss of the
other half of the credits was reflected in the fourth quarter.
    In a discussion of steel results, USX said plants that were
shut down last month and some previously idled plants may be
permanently closed. USX took a fourth quarter charge of 1.03
billion dlrs to restructure its steel operations. The charge
included the "indefinite idling" last month of four plants in
Utah, Pennsylvania and Texas.
    Other plants or parts of plants in Pennsylvania, Indiana,
Alabama, Ohio and Chicago had been previously idled.
    "These operations are not permanently shut down. Improved
market conditions for the products from these plants may make
it feasible to reopen some of them," USX said in the report.
    "On the other hand, a lack of any future market improvement
may necessitate their permanent closing," it added.

<TITLE>PHILLIPS&lt;P> SAYS STOCK UP ON STEPS TO PARE DEBT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Phillips Petroleum Co Chairman C. J.
"Pete" Silas said his company's stock, ranked fourth on the
most active list of stocks traded today, rose partly because of
steps it took to pare its debt.
    Silas told Reuters in an interview today, "part of this
strength results from the rise in oil prices and also because
some of the analysts have been happy with the steps we've taken
in 1986 to pare our debt."
    Phillips stocks rose 1/4 to 14 dlrs a share following
recommendations by some oil analysts, a company source said.
    Phillips debt stood at 5.9 billion dlrs in December 1986
down from a 1985 high of 8.6 billion dlrs, analysts said.
    "At 14 dlrs a share, Phillips is priced closer to the actual
price of oil," he added.
    Silas said, "if the analysts are right that oil prices will
rise to 20 dlrs or higher, then it seems to make sense to buy
Phillips." He is, however, more cautious about the strength in
crude prices, expecting the price to fluctuate between 16-18
dlrs a barrel for the year.
    Oil industry analysts said one reason for the stock's
popularity of the stock is that it traded at a strong discount
to its appraised value and was attractively priced for small
investors.
    Charles Andrew, an analyst who follows Phillips for John S.
Herold Inc of Greenwich, Conn said that the appraised value of
the company, based on available data is 34.25 dlrs.
    "The stock is trading at about 1/3 its appraised value. The
company has tremendous leverage and if it can get its act
together and if oil prices are steady to higher there is good
room for improvement," he said.
   But, he added, "if oil prices turn lower, there will be a
lot of pressure on Phillips."
   Phillips' shares fell as low as eight dlrs a share over the
last 52 weeks with a 1987 low of 11-3/4 dlrs in 1987.   
Analysts say that the appraised value of the company could be
revised due to asset sales of their oil and gas reserves.
   Silas told Reuters that the asset sales which amount to
about two billion dlrs for 1986 were completed and that none
were planned.

<TITLE>MICHIGAN GENERAL &lt;MGL> BEGINS EXCHANGE OFFER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    SADDLE BROOK, N.J., march 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Michigan General Corp said
it began an exchange offer for its 110 mln dlrs outstanding
principal amount of 10-3/4 pct senior subordinated debentures
due December 1, 1998.
    Pursuant to the exchange offer, each 1,000 dlr principal
amount will receive 500 dlr principal amount of senior
subordinated notes due March 1, 1992, 200 dlr principal amount
of non-interest bearing convertible senior subordainted notes
due March 1, 1997 and 12 shares of delayed convertible
preferred stock, liquidation preference 25 dlrs per share.
    The offer will expire April nine.
    Michigan General said the exchange offer is crucial to is
attempt to restructure and reduce its risk from Chapter 11.
    The principal purpose of the offer is to reduce its debt
service on the 10-3/4 pct debetures, increase stockholders'
equity and induce its lender to continue to fund.
    Assuming a 90 pct acceptance of the offer, Michigan's
annual cash interest requirements will be reduced by about 10.6
mln dlrs, it said.
    Completion is subject to the tender of at least 90 pct of
the debentures and its lender to waive it from default under
its loan agreements.

<TITLE>BANK OF B.C. REVISES SHARE PAYOUT ESTIMATE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bank of British
Columbia said it revised its estimate of shareholder
distributions from last November's sale of most of the bank's
assets to HongKong Bank of Canada to between 65 cts and 1.15
dlrs a share from 55 cts to 1.20 dlrs a share.
    The bank said the estimate could rise to between 1.30 dlrs
and 1.80 dlrs a share if the full pension surplus is obtained.
It said it did not know when distributions would be made.
    It earlier reported that operating profit for first quarter
ended January 31 fell to 273,000 dlrs from 1.7 mln dlrs the
previous year.
    For full-year 1986 ended October 31, the bank posted an
operating loss of 4.4 mln dlrs against year-earlier profit of
7.5 mln dlrs. The bank also posted a 66 mln dlr extraordinary
loss in fiscal 1986.
    Bank of British Columbia sold most of its assets last
November to HongKong Bank Canada, a unit of &lt;HongKong and
Shanghai Banking Corp>, of Hong Kong, for 63.5 mln dlrs.
    It said efforts to wind up the bank's affairs were
proceeding as quickly as possible.
    The bank said it expected to report positive earnings in
future periods, barring unforeseen circumstances.
    Loan losses, which the bank previously said figured in its
move to sell off most of its assets, rose to 105.7 mln dlrs in
fiscal 1986 from year-earlier 36.1 mln dlrs. The bank said 31.1
mln dlrs of the 1986 total represented downward adjustments to
its portfolio of syndicated sovereign risk loans as required
under the sale to HongKong Bank.
    Since November 27, the bank has confined activities to the
winding up of affairs, Bank of British Columbia said.

<TITLE>HOUSE VOTES TO BLOCK CONTRA AID FOR SIX MONTHS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 11 - </DATELINE><BODY>The House voted to block 40 mln dlrs
in military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels until President Reagan
accounts for past assistance, including money diverted from the
U.S. sale of arms to Iran.
    The vote was seen as a temporary defeat for Reagan, who has
made aid to the "contras" a key initiative.
    Congressional Democratic leaders have conceded that despite
today's vote, they can not muster a two-thirds majority to
override a certain Reagan veto. But they have said it is likely
they can win a battle expected this fall over 105 mln dlrs iin
new aid Reagan is requesting.
